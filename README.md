# OneGesture
Control your computer with just one gesture.



<u>This project is not a formal project or something important, and it is written by me just because I got bored during reading books.</u>

Details:

- Using **MediaPipe** as main framework
- Need a simple usb-camera ðŸ“·
- Using **AppleScript** to control computers so it does not work on Windows.
- I wrote just one gesture to control music volume. But actually, it is extensible. For example, you can add a gesture that signifies anger and set it as a operation to delete a line of code. ðŸ˜‚
